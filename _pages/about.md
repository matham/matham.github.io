I work in a [neuroscience lab](https://cplab.net/) at Cornell University as a lab tech - my job is to write software and create hardware that lets the students in the lab run their experiments more efficiently, or to automate experiments overall.

I graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor's degree in bio-engineering. After joining the lab, my main interest was initially in developing or bridging hardware to control experiments and write software to control the hardware. For example I developed USB-[FTDI](https://www.ftdichip.com/) based PCB boards that controls valves to precisely release odors and sample the resulting sniffing response from rats and mice. See [hardware projects](/hardware_projects/) for a list of projects.

More recently my focus has been more on software, especially Python. I am a core developer of the [Kivy project](/software_projects/kivy/). My main focus there has been to bring desktop support up to the levels of mobile support, optimize the core modules algorithmically and using cython, and improve distribution. Much of my focus has been on support for the Window OS. E.g. I added windows continuous integration and wheel support. I also added anaconda support for Kivy.

In the last couple of years I completed a master of engineering degree in Computer Science here at Cornell University. I mostly took machine learning courses based on personal interest. And for my project I worked on the [distopia project](/software_projects/distopia/). At work I have been primarily focusing on the [Ceed](/software_projects/ceed/) project, which is the largest application I have written so far.

I have always been passionate to use my skills to help improve real world projects by working on projects that help others be more productive.
